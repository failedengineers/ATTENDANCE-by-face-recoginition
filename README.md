# Face Recognition Attendance System

This is a fully functional Python-based **Face Recognition Attendance System** designed to simplify and automate attendance tracking. The system leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify individuals and record attendance efficiently.

## Features

- **Student Details Management**: Add, update, or delete student records.
- **Face Recognition**: Real-time face detection and recognition using a pre-trained dataset.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Automatically logs attendance with name, date, and time.
- **Training and Testing Dataset**: Train the system with new datasets to improve accuracy.
- **Helpdesk**: Provides support and guidance for troubleshooting issues.
- **Photo Gallery**: Displays captured images used for training and attendance.
- **Developer Info**: Includes the creator's information.
- **Exit Functionality**: Securely close the application.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - OpenCV (for face detection and image processing)
  - face_recognition (for face matching and encoding)
  - Tkinter (for GUI development)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Add student photos to create a training dataset.
   - Train the model using the "Train Data" feature.

2. **Real-Time Recognition**:
   - The system captures the live video feed.
   - Recognizes registered faces using the pre-trained dataset.

3. **Attendance Logging**:
   - Matches recognized faces to student records.
   - Logs attendance with date and time in a structured format.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Navigate through the GUI to access all features, including training, recognition, and attendance.




## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Entry point for the application.
- **dataset/**: Stores images used for training.
- **attendance.csv**: Logs attendance records.
- **modules/**: Contains core functions for face recognition, training, and data management.
- **templates/**: GUI templates and assets.


## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by:
- Improving the GUI.
- Adding new features like reporting or analytics.
- Optimizing the face recognition algorithm.
